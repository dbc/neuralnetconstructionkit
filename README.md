# neuralnetconstructionkit
Simple-minded Tensorflow neural-net builder.

As a total Tensorflow beginner, I learned very quickly
that there is a lot of tedious booking involved in
building a neural net.  So I wrote a tool.  This is it.

I was a total Tensorflow beginner the day I started
this module, so don't be surprised if it is 
re-inventing several wheels and only marginally
useful.  I did it mainly as a learning exercise.
